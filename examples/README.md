## 3D demos
The examples contain comparisons between 3D reconstruction/abstraction from marching cubes and marching primitives from the same SDF.
`*_mc.stl` is obtained from marching cubes, and `*_mps.stl` is obtained from marhing primitives.
All the 3D models are from [sketchfab](https://sketchfab.com/features/free-3d-models).
All the `.stl` and `.jpg` files are adapted from the original meshes, and licensed under [CC BY-NC-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/) by [Weixiao Liu](https://github.com/bmlklwx).
